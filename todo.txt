when running and an output already exists, the following are possible actions:

input hash and output hash already matched -> do nothing

neither input hash nor output hash exist ->  append new canned response

output hash exists but input hash doesn't -> add input hash to canned match list

input hash exists but output hash doesn't exist (something changed)

a) input hash was only one in match list -> rewrite output with new response
b) input hash was in a list -> remove input hash from list, make new dedicated entry.

support a training file that has different invocations of the command 

compress outputs?

break outputs into a separate helper file? have this as optional? Pickle + compress?

provisions to use by other modules (like an advanced training module that tries to understand input argument syntax.)

generate regex for input arguments if syntax is understood

simple lexical analysis before hashing?  shlex.split() 

maybe naive hashing of input is good enough

============ done =========================
Have a hash for input arguments and hash for output response.
